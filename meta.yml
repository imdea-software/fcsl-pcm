  Coq library of Partial Commutative Monoids
description: |-
  The PCM library provides a formalisation of Partial Commutative Monoids (PCMs),
  a common algebraic structure used in separation logic for verification of
  pointer-manipulating sequential and concurrent programs.

  The library provides lemmas for mechanised and automated reasoning about PCMs
  in the abstract, but also supports concrete common PCM instances, such as heaps,
  histories, and mutexes.

  This library relies on propositional and functional extentionality axioms.

  ## Getting help

  If you need assistance or would like to report a bug, drop us an email:
  <fcsl@software.imdea.org> or open an [issue](https://github.com/imdea-software/fcsl-pcm/issues).

  ## History and context

  More information can be obtained via the [FCSL web page](https://software.imdea.org/fcsl/).

  An earlier version of this library was developed as a part of [Hoare type
  theory](https://github.com/imdea-software/htt), which is now rebased on FCSL-PCM. The original
  version of HTT can be found [here](https://software.imdea.org/~aleks/htt/).
